# Software-Security
Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?
Artemis Financial wanted to expand their application to a larger global market, but were concerned with meeting international security requirements. We were tasked with evaluating the current security of the application, reporting on their vulnerabilities, and adding layers to their security using industry standard practices.
What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?
We identified and mitigated software security vulnerabilities by implementing HTTPS for secure communication and integrating SHA-256 hashing for data integrity checks. Secure coding practices were crucial to safeguard sensitive data and maintain trust with stakeholders. Coding securely is essential to protect against cyber threats, maintain data confidentiality, and comply with regulatory requirements. It enhances resilience against breaches and ensures the application's reliability and trustworthiness. Software security adds significant value to a company's well-being by safeguarding intellectual property, customer data, and brand reputation. It reduces risks of financial losses, legal liabilities, and operational disruptions caused by security incidents.
Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
Combing through the dependency reports was the most informative, but I initially had trouble identifying false positives within the report to supress.
How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
We increased layers of security by implementing HTTPS encryption, integrating robust cryptographic algorithms, and conducting regular security assessments. This approach mitigates vulnerabilities and strengthens defenses against evolving cyber threats.
How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
To assess vulnerabilities in the future, we would use automated vulnerability scanners, conduct penetration testing, and follow industry best practices for secure coding and configuration management. These methods help prioritize and implement effective mitigation strategies. After refactoring, we ensured functionality and security through rigorous testing, including unit testing for code logic and integration testing for system behavior. Security-specific testing verified the implementation of secure practices and detected any new vulnerabilities introduced.
What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
Resources such as OWASP guidelines, secure coding libraries, and tools like static code analyzers (e.g., SonarQube) were instrumental. Adopting version control practices and continuous integration tools also ensured code quality and security integrity.
Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
Future employers might be interested in examples demonstrating HTTPS implementation, cryptographic integration, vulnerability assessment reports, and successful security refactorings. These showcase technical proficiency, proactive security measures, and adherence to industry standards.
